					<h1 id="font4">The Story of Betty and James</h1>
					<p class="p1">Taylor Swift’s folklore was a surprise album, written over the course of quarantine and released on July 24th, 2020. As her 8th studio album, folklore portrays an aspect of story telling unlike any other record she has put out. And, as she is the storytelling queen, it takes her lyrical composure to a whole new level.
						<br><br> I wanted to share my theory of what story the album tells (folklore’s all encompassing ‘folklore’). I was sitting outside one day, listening to this album on repeat for a good few hours, when I had a full blown “epiphany” - get it? (maybe not yet, but you will) - and jotted this entire theory into my notes app. And I know I’m not (that) crazy for making this, because the rest of the internet </p>
				</div>
				<div id="intro">
					<p class="p1">has been creating similar ones. The connections throughout each of the tracks really are undeniable, but they also each have such a strong duality to where it seems like the meaning can’t just be this one thing I came up with. That being said, this is the only theory about the album I will ever subscribe to - but I think that could be the point? For the connections and storyline and character development to all be this totally ambiguous set of tracks that are solely meant for unique audience interpretation?
					<br> <br> “A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables” - Taylor Swift <br>
					If this isn’t proof that Taylor totally meant for this theory to be made, I don’t know what is. But anyways this is my interpretation of it, whether she wanted it or not.</p>

					<p class="p1">“seven” tells of taylor’s childhood and her memories of growing up in Pennsylvania. It shows her growth and the changes throughout her life, yet also focuses on the things that have stayed the same.</p>
					<div class="quote" id="font3">“I hit my peak at seven feet in the swing over the creek, I was too scared to jump in. But I was high in the sky, with Pennsylvania under me. Are there still beautiful things?"</div>

				<div class="seven">
					<div class="quote" id="font3">“passed down like folk songs, our love lasts so long”</div>
					<p class="p2">In mentioning the presence of folk stories in her childhood, she suggests how the folk songs all connect to her own life. This introduces the folk story of Betty and James that follows.</p>
