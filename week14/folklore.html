					<h1 id="font4">The Story of Betty and James</h1>
					<p class="p1">Taylor Swift’s folklore was a surprise album, written over the course of quarantine and released on July 24th, 2020. As her 8th studio album, folklore portrays an aspect of story telling unlike any other record she has put out. And, as she is the storytelling queen, it takes her lyrical composure to a whole new level.
						<br><br> I wanted to share my theory of what story the album tells (folklore’s all encompassing ‘folklore’). I was sitting outside one day, listening to this album on repeat for a good few hours, when I had a full blown “epiphany” - get it? (maybe not yet, but you will) - and jotted this entire theory into my notes app. And I know I’m not (that) crazy for making this, because the rest of the internet has been creating similar ones. The connections throughout each of the tracks really are</p>

				<div id="intro">
					<p class="p1"> undeniable, but they also each have such a strong duality to where it seems like the meaning can’t just be this one thing I came up with. That being said, this is the only theory about the album I will ever fully believe - but I think that could be the point? For the connections and storyline and character development to all be this totally ambiguous set of tracks that are solely meant for unique audience interpretation?</p>
					<div id="font3" class="quote">"A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables”</div> 
					<p class="p1">- Taylor Swift <br> <br> If this isn’t proof that Taylor totally meant for this theory to be made, I don’t know what is. But anyways this is my interpretation of it, whether she wanted it or not.</p>

					<h1 id="font3">Seven</h1>
					<p class="p1">“seven” tells of taylor’s childhood and her memories of growing up in Pennsylvania. It shows her growth and the changes throughout her life, yet also focuses on the things that have stayed the same. This song and each song that follows, as Taylor says, “started with imagery” - the visual for this one in particular being inspired by “the tree swing in the woods of [her] childhood.”</p>
					<div class="quote2" id="font3">“Please picture me in the trees, i hit my peak at seven feet in the swing over the creek, I was too scared to jump in. But I was high in the sky, with Pennsylvania under me. Are there still beautiful things?"</div>
				</div>
				<div class="seven">
					<div class="quote2" id="font3">“and just like a folk song, our love will be passed on”</div>
					<p class="p1">In mentioning the presence of folk stories in her childhood, she suggests how the folk songs all connect to her own life. This introduces the folk story of Betty and James that follows.</p>

					<h1 id="font4">betty</h1>
					<p>This track introduces the characters within this folklore in a first person story telling format from the perspective of of a teenage boy - james - and his view of the high school love triangle he got himself into. It acts as James’ apology for his ignorance and betrayal, as he realizes his mistakes in cheating on Betty, and hopes to win her back. </p>
					<div class="quote" id="font4">“the worst thing that i ever did was what i did to you”</div>
					<p>James describe the night of the school dance the previous year, when it all began.</p> 
					<div class="quote" id="font4">“betty, I know where it all went wrong your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym. I was nowhere to be found I hate, the crowds you know that, plus I saw you dance with him”</div>
				</div>
				<div class="betty">
					<div class="quote">“I was walking home on broken cobblestones just thinking of you when she pulled up like the figment of my worst intentions. She said ‘James get in, let’s drive.’ Those days turned into nights. Slept next to her , but I dreamt of you all summer long”</div>
					<div class="quote">“would you trust me if I told you it was just a summer thing?”</div>
					<p>James has finally come to terms with the foolishness of his actions, and is finally finding the words to say to Betty as his apology. The track ends on a hopeful note in describing how James is hoping Betty will react.</p>
					<div class="quote">“betty im here on your doorstep and I planned it out for weeks now but its finally sinking in. . .  the only thing i want to do is make it up to you. So i showed up at your party, will you have me? will you love me?”</div>
