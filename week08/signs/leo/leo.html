                    Just as the sun is the center point of our solar system, the sun signs represent the center aspects of a person. Your sun sign is one of twelve zodiacs that is based on the position of the Earth in relation to the sun on the day you were born. Because the sun has the strongest pull on the earth, sun signs influence people the most. Therefore, your sun sign can tell you the core characteristics of who you are and how you express yourself to the world.

                        The ruling planet of a sign determines many of its associated character traits. The Sun is the symbol of expression and identity, which is why one's sun sign carries so much significance as to who they are at their core. As the sign that is ruled by the sun, Leos are fundamentally bold and proud, drawing from their certainty and confidence in who they are. This aspect of self-awareness also draws on the sun's reliance on reason, as opposed to instincts or dreams. The sun is often referred to as the "giver of life," which, for leos, translates into brightness and warmth in their personality. And, as a fire sign ruled by the sun, Leos are especially known for their love of attention, sometimes causing them to think they are the center of the universe.

                    A sign's quality correlates strongly to their relation to the seasons. The fixed signs all fall under the middle of the seasons, making them often known as the stabilizers who act as the middle grounds. Leo season is during the middle of summer, emphasizing their warmth, generosity, and bright spirits. And because they are the fixed fire sign, this warmth is emphasized through their care for others, and strengthens their ability to make those around them feel just as cheerful. Additionally, Leo's are represented by the Lion, making them the Kings and Queens of the zodiac and giving them an extreme sense of self-love. Their love for the spotlight is certainly heightened by their fixed quality, however, so their confidence can somtimes turn into arrogance.
