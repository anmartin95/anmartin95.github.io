        Within Understanding Comics by Scott McCould, one section that particularly 
        stood out to me was Chapter Two, The Vocabulary of Comics. Right away, the 
        message of this chapter became abundantly clear to me with each correction 
        regarding the painting “The Treachery of Images” by Magritte. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only did this section encourage me to rethink what the description of this 
        image should be with each following point that was made, but it also gave me a 
        better understanding of perspective when viewing different art forms.

        This comic also gave me a further look into different ways of communicating ideas 
        and messages beyond the standard realm of explanations.

        The icons that were displayed in this section especially gave me a stronger sense 
        of what becomes entwined with words or images, such as “concepts, ideas and 
        philosophies.”
