# "Inteactive Concept Album" is designed to be an immersive storybook experience, where the story told within an album is brough to life visually and descriptively. 
# I encorporated the Turn.js library in order to visually broadcast how albums can be cohesive and reminiscent of a continual story rather than individual tracks on an unconnected record.

# "Learn About Your Zodiac Sun Sign" calculates your sun sign from the user's birthday input, and redirects you to an informative site about that sign. 
# The objective of this site is to display the various features of each zodiac sign and where these features stem from.
#
# "Cafe Java Game" is a javaScript game designed to mimic a coffee shop worker's experience, where a fast-paced and chaotic environment is created through random image elements appending to a canvas in a falling motion. 
# This site was designed in collaboration with Anita Dazzo, using the jQuery library and Adobe Photoshop for the falling image elements.
