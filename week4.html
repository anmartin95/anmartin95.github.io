            <h2><i>As We May Think</i> by Vannevar Bush</h2>
            <center><p>
                Bush highlights the remarkable changes that modern scientific advancements has made on the world at large. 
                Written and published in 1945, he specifically connects the influences of science to the then current events 
                of the second World War, emphasizing the effects of the war as a global, universal impact, stating "This has 
                not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part."

            <h2><i>Long Live The Web</i> by Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
            <center><p>
                Tim Berners-Lee, British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web, sums up his article 
                on the importance of sustanance of the internet, titled "Long Live the Web," with the phrase "we take 
                it for granted, expecting it to “be there” at any instant, like electricity." The web, "an interconnected 
                information space," as Berners-Lee puts it, is a public resource built on egalitarian principles that are 
                fundamental to our basic rights. Berners-Lee emphasizes its importance in explaining its link to democracy, 
                innovation, and the principle of universality. These principles, I believe, are a defining feature of 
                today's day and age, and continue to shape how the world operates in every aspect.
